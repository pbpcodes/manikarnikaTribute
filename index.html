              <h2>A brief timeline of Manikarnika</h2>
              <h3>And how she became Rani LaxmiBai</h3> <hr>
              <ul>
                <li>Rani Lakshmibai was born on 19 November 1828, in the town of Varanasi into a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family. She was named <b>Manikarnika Tambe</b> and was nicknamed <b>Manu</b>.</li>
                <li>Rani Lakshmibai contrasted many of the patriarchal cultural expectations for women in India's society at that time.</li>
                <li>She was really fond of <b>Horses</b>.</li>
                <li>Her horses included <em>Sarangi, Pavan and Baadal</em>; according to historians she rode <strong>Baadal</strong> when escaping from the Jhansi fort in 1858.</li>
                <li>Manikarnika was married to the <i>Maharaja of Jhansi</i>, <strong>Gangadhar Rao Newalkar</strong>, in <b>May 1842</b> and was afterwards called <strong>Lakshmibai (or Laxmibai)</strong> in honour of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi and according to the traditions.</li>
                <li>She gave birth to a boy, later named Damodar Rao, in 1851, who died after four months.</li>
                <li>The Maharaja adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who was renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before the Maharaja died. </li>
                <li>After the death of the Maharaja in November 1853, because Damodar Rao (born Anand Rao) was an adopted son, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao's claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories.</li>
                <li>According to Vishnu Bhatt Godse the Rani would exercise at weightlifting, wrestling and steeplechasing before breakfast. An intelligent and simply-dressed woman, she ruled in a business-like manner.</li>
                <li><strong><em>She fought in the 1857 Revolt as one of the most fierce warriors ever born on this sacred land.</em></strong></li>
